Included in this folder are a series of text files containing archival typhoon data from the central Pacific Ocean for the years 1945-2007.

Each year's data is in a separate directory.  Within that directory, a series of comma-seperated-value text files, one per tropical storm, contains the archival data for that storm.  See the file "FormatExplanation.txt" for an explanation of the data format.

There is much extraneous data for each storm, but included therein is a series of position reports.  By examining the file formats, it can be learned which columns of data contain the date, time, latitude and longitude information for each storm's position.

Desired is to focus on an area of the ocean bounded by the Equator, 23 Degrees South latitude, 160 Degrees West longitude and 180 Degrees West longitude.  Any storm whose track which does not pass through this region should be ignored and not processed further.

For any storm which does pass through 160W-180W, 00S-20S, the track of that storm within that region should be plotted in a graphical format. This may be accomplished by plotting the locations in the storm track text file, and joining plotted locations with straight lines.  Storm tracks so plotted should be labeled with storm name (or designation) and the dates of the appropriate locations.
