Fields currently used for best track records: 
BASIN, CY, YYYYMMDDHH, , TECH, TAU, LatN/S, LonE/W, VMAX, MSLP, TY 
TECH = BEST 
TAU = 0 

All fields are used for objective-aids history records (CARQ,WRNG,COMS): 
TECHNUM = 01 - CARQ and COMS, 00 - WRNG 
TECH = CARQ, WRNG, COMS 
INITIALS for WRNG/OFCL record 
Repeated for tau -24 through tau 0 

Fields for objective-aids forecasts records: 
BASIN, CY, YYYYMMDDHH, TECHNUM, TECH, TAU, LatN/S, LonE/W, VMAX, MSLP, TY, RAD, WINDCODE, RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4 
Repeated for tau 0 through tau 120 
Wind records merged in from existing r-decks will be assigned a TECH of CNTR. Wind records created during normal use of the combined abr-deck will be assigned the TECH corresponding to the center name as defined in $ATCFINC/atcfsite.nam.
